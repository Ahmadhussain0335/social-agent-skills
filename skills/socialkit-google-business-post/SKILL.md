# Google Business Profile post

Apply social-core. Official API only. Setup: [setup](references/setup.md).

## Rules

- The user's Google Cloud project must be approved for the Business Profile APIs first (see setup).
- Find options.location with `node scripts/auth.mjs --platform google-business --locations`.
- Photos must be at public https URLs.

## Steps

1. Sign in once (browser, local redirect): `node scripts/auth.mjs --platform google-business`
2. Create the post folder with the social-core post script:
   `node <social-core>/scripts/post.mjs --init --dir gbp-<slug> --platform google-business --kind <standard|event|offer>`
3. Write `post.json` (text, media with alt text, options). See `node scripts/publish.mjs --help`.
4. Validate: `node scripts/publish.mjs --check --dir gbp-<slug>`
5. Stop. Show the post. Ask the user to approve in their own terminal:
   `node <social-core>/scripts/post.mjs --approve --dir gbp-<slug>`
6. Publish: `node scripts/publish.mjs --publish --dir gbp-<slug>` and report the result.

## Failure handling

- Quota or 429 errors: the project is not approved yet; see setup.
- `GBP_403`: the account cannot manage this location.
- `APPROVAL_REQUIRED`: the post changed after approval; ask again.
- `ALREADY_PUBLISHED`: this folder was posted; use `--allow-repost` only if the user asks.
