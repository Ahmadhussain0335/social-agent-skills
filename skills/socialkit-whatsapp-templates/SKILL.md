# WhatsApp templates

Official Cloud API only. Setup: [setup](references/setup.md).

## Steps

1. Ask what the message is for, then pick the category honestly:
   - UTILITY: about an existing order, booking or account (shipping update, reminder)
   - MARKETING: anything promotional; Meta re-categorises promotional utility drafts
   - AUTHENTICATION: one-time passcodes only
2. Create a folder and skeleton: `node scripts/templates.mjs --init --dir wa-tpl-<name> --name <name>`
3. Edit `template.json`: body text with `{{1}}`, `{{2}}` variables in order, an example
   value for every variable, optional header, footer and buttons. Apply social-core voice.
4. Validate: `node scripts/templates.mjs --check --dir wa-tpl-<name>` and fix every error.
5. Stop. Show the template and ask the user to run, in their own terminal:
   `node scripts/templates.mjs --approve --dir wa-tpl-<name>`
6. Submit: `node scripts/templates.mjs --submit --dir wa-tpl-<name>`
7. Check review status later: `node scripts/templates.mjs --status --name <name>`

## Output contract

`template.json`, the check report, and after submission the template id and status.

## Failure handling

- `APPROVAL_REQUIRED`: the template changed or was never approved; ask again.
- REJECTED status: show `rejected_reason`, revise, and go through approval again.
- Error 100 with subcode 2388024: a template with this name and language exists; pick a new name.
