# Instagram post

Apply social-core. Setup: [setup](references/setup.md). Sign in with meta-auth
(`--platform facebook`); the Instagram account must be linked to a connected Page.

## Media rules

- Images: JPEG at a public `https://` URL. Instagram downloads them; local image files
  cannot be uploaded. Ask the user where they host images if needed.
- Reels and story videos: a local MP4/MOV file is uploaded directly, or use an https URL.
- Carousel: 2 to 10 items, all by https URL.
- No scheduling through the API.

## Steps

1. `node <social-core>/scripts/post.mjs --init --dir ig-<slug> --platform instagram --kind <image|carousel|reel|story>`
2. Write `post.json` caption (`text`) within 2,200 characters, 30 hashtags, 20 mentions;
   add `altText` to images.
3. `node scripts/publish.mjs --check --dir ig-<slug>`
4. Stop. Ask the user to approve in their own terminal:
   `node <social-core>/scripts/post.mjs --approve --dir ig-<slug>`
5. `node scripts/publish.mjs --publish --dir ig-<slug>`. Report the permalink and the
   remaining daily quota.

## Failure handling

- Subcode 2207052: the media URL is not publicly reachable.
- `IG_DAILY_LIMIT` or subcode 2207042: daily publishing limit reached; try tomorrow.
- `IG_ACCOUNT_UNKNOWN`: link a Business/Creator account to the Page, then run meta-auth again.
- `META_MEDIA_TIMEOUT`: the video is still processing; nothing was published.
