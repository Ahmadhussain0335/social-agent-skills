# LinkedIn post

Apply social-core. Official API only. Setup: [setup](references/setup.md).

## Rules

- Posts go to the personal profile; company pages need the Community Management API and options.organizationUrn.
- Link previews are not fetched: set options.title (and options.description) for link posts.
- The sign-in lasts 60 days and cannot be refreshed; sign in again when it expires.

## Steps

1. Sign in once: `node scripts/auth.mjs --platform linkedin --start`, give the user the `signInUrl`, then `node scripts/auth.mjs --platform linkedin --finish --url "<URL they landed on>"`.
2. Create the post folder with the social-core post script:
   `node <social-core>/scripts/post.mjs --init --dir li-<slug> --platform linkedin --kind <text|link|image|video>`
3. Write `post.json` (text, media with alt text, options). See `node scripts/publish.mjs --help`.
4. Validate: `node scripts/publish.mjs --check --dir li-<slug>`
5. Stop. Show the post. Ask the user to approve in their own terminal:
   `node <social-core>/scripts/post.mjs --approve --dir li-<slug>`
6. Publish: `node scripts/publish.mjs --publish --dir li-<slug>` and report the result.

## Failure handling

- `LINKEDIN_401`: sign in again.
- Version errors: set LINKEDIN_VERSION to a current YYYYMM version.
- `APPROVAL_REQUIRED`: the post changed after approval; ask again.
- `ALREADY_PUBLISHED`: this folder was posted; use `--allow-repost` only if the user asks.
