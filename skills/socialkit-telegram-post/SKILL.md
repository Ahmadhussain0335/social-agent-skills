# Telegram post

Apply social-core. Official API only. Setup: [setup](references/setup.md).

## Rules

- The bot must be an administrator of the channel with permission to post.
- Captions are limited to 1,024 characters; text messages to 4,096.
- Plain text by default; set options.parseMode to HTML only when formatting is needed.

## Steps

1. Check the credentials in [setup](references/setup.md) are set (environment variables only).
2. Create the post folder with the social-core post script:
   `node <social-core>/scripts/post.mjs --init --dir tg-<slug> --platform telegram --kind <text|photo|video|album>`
3. Write `post.json` (text, media with alt text, options). See `node scripts/publish.mjs --help`.
4. Validate: `node scripts/publish.mjs --check --dir tg-<slug>`
5. Stop. Show the post. Ask the user to approve in their own terminal:
   `node <social-core>/scripts/post.mjs --approve --dir tg-<slug>`
6. Publish: `node scripts/publish.mjs --publish --dir tg-<slug>` and report the result.

## Failure handling

- `TELEGRAM_403`: add the bot as an admin of the channel.
- `TELEGRAM_400` chat not found: check TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID.
- `APPROVAL_REQUIRED`: the post changed after approval; ask again.
- `ALREADY_PUBLISHED`: this folder was posted; use `--allow-repost` only if the user asks.
